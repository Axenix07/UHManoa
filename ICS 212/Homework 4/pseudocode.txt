*** Assume the following variables are already defined. ***

- start: The pointer to the first record of the list (or NULL) (assuming start is already dereferenced from record **)
- uaccountno: The user's account number (integer)
- uname: a character array containing the user's name
- uaddress: a character array containing the user's address
