Add Method:
    Worst-case: O(n) When inserting at the end of the list, iterating through all elements.
    Best-case: O(1) When inserting at the head of the list.
    Average-case: O(n) Typically inserting somewhere in the middle, requiring traversal.

Remove Method:
    Worst-case: O(n) When removing an element at the end.
    Best-case: O(1) When removing the first element.
    Average-case: O(n) Requires traversal to locate the node to remove.
