ArrayList (Backed by an array)
	Best-case, worst-case, and average-case: O(1)
	ArrayList.get(index) is a direct array access (O(1)), so next() runs in constant time.
	
Singly Linked List
    Best-case: O(1) (If cursor stays at or near the beginning)
    Worst-case: O(n) (If cursor is near the end, requiring traversal from the head)
    Average-case: O(n) (Since each next() call has to traverse from the head up to cursor, iterating through the entire list takes O(n) in total)
    
Doubly Linked List
    Best-case: O(1) (If cursor stays near the beginning or if the list implementation optimizes traversal)
    Worst-case: O(n) (If the get() method starts traversal from the head)
    Average-case: O(n) (If get() is not optimized)
