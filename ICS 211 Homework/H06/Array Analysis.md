The **add(String value)** method has a best-case time complexity of **O(1)**, occurring when the value already exists in the array, allowing an early exit, or when there is enough space, enabling insertion at the end without shifting. The **worst-case complexity is O(n)**, which happens when the value is smaller than all elements, necessitating a full shift, or when the array is full, triggering a costly resize. Additionally, the **indexOf(value)** method runs in **O(n)** before insertion. The **average-case complexity remains O(n)** since, typically, about half the elements must be shifted, and **indexOf(value)** contributes **O(n)**, with binary search taking **O(n)** in the worst case due to its linear search implementation. Similarly, the **remove(String value)** method has a **best-case complexity of O(1)** when the element is at the end of the array and can be removed with a simple assignment and decrement operation. However, in the **worst case, O(n)** time is required when the value is at the start, forcing all elements to shift left, and **indexOf(value)** takes **O(n)** to locate the element. The **average-case complexity is also O(n)** since, on average, about half the elements must be shifted after removing a value, with **indexOf(value)** contributing **O(n)** in the worst case.
